 Apply a maximum GPU frequency constraint to the PDVFS firmware governor.
 If a maximum GPU freq constraint is already in place, it is replaced
 with the new OPP point.

 with the new OPP point.

 @Function	PDVFSResetFrequencyConstraints

 @Description
 Reset the minimum/maximum GPU frequency constraints in the PDVFS firmware
 governor. Both the constraints are reset to their default values,
 usually the lowest and highest available operating performance points.

 @Function	PDVFSSetFrequencyHeadroom

 @Description
 Set a headroom frequency which is added (or subtracted, if less than zero)
 to the DVFS governor best-available frequency. This should be set to
 provide capacity headroom when the GPU load is anticipated to increase
 in a short period of time. The headroom should be removed when the GPU
 load returns to steady/normal operation.

 @Input	   psDevInfo : RGX Device
 @Input	   i32Headroom : Signed frequency value (in Hz). A large value
           relative to the operating frequency will reduce power
           efficiency and/or performance.

 @Return   PVRSRV_ERROR : OK - the firmware processed the config update.

 Set the polling interval between reactive frequency updates.
 Analogous to the 'polling_interval' parameter in Linux devfreq.
