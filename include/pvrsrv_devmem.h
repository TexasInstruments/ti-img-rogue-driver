@InGroup        DevMemAPIs
@Function       PVRSRVCreateDeviceMemContext
@Description    Creates a device memory context.  There is a one-to-one
                correspondence between this context data structure and the
                top level MMU page table (known as the Page Catalogue, in the
                case of a 3-tier MMU). It is intended that a process with its
                own virtual space on the CPU will also have its own virtual
                space on the GPU. Thus there is loosely a one-to-one
                correspondence between process and device memory context, but
                this is not enforced at this API.

                Every process must create the device memory context before any
                memory allocations are made, and is responsible for freeing
                all such allocations before destroying the context

                This is a wrapper function above the "bare-metal" device
                memory context creation function which would create just a
                context and no heaps. This function will also create the
                heaps, according to the heap config that the device specific
                initialization code has nominated for use by this API.

                The number of heaps thus created is returned to the caller,
                such that the caller can allocate an array and the call in to
                fetch details of each heap, or look up the heap with the
                "Find Heap" API described below.

                In order to derive the details of the MMU configuration for
                the device, and for retrieving the "bridge handle" for
                communication internally in services, it is necessary to pass
                in a PVRSRV_DEV_CONNECTION.

                                for this.

                This handle can be used for e.g. the breakpoint functions.

                The context will be only available to other processes that are
                able to pass in a memory descriptor that is shared between
                this and the importing process. We use the memory descriptor
                to identify the correct context and verify that the caller is
                allowed to request the context.

                The whole mechanism is intended to be used with the debugger
                that for example can load USC breakpoint handlers into the
                shared allocation and then use the acquired remote context
                (that is exported here) to set/clear breakpoints in USC code.
