/*
 * These IDs are replicated in the Device Memory allocation flags to allow
 * allocations to be made in terms of their locality/use to ensure the correct
 * physical heap is accessed for the given system/platform configuration.
 * A system Phys Heap Config is linked to one or more Phys Heaps. When a heap
 * is not present in the system configuration the allocation will fallback to
 * the default GPU_LOCAL physical heap which all systems must define.
 * See PVRSRV_MEMALLOCFLAGS_*_MAPPABLE_MASK.
 *
 * On some platforms the Firmware needs separate physheaps for code and private
 * data. These can be instantiated from physheap configs provided by the system
 * layer or the generic FW_SHARED physheap config can be partitioned into
 * multiple physheaps. A combination of the two approach is also supported:
 * any subheaps required that don't have a dedicated heap config are carved out
 * from FW_SHARED.
 *
 * Premapping: Under AutoVz or drivers built with RGX_PREMAP_FW_HEAPS the Fw
 * heaps of the host driver must be premapped, i.e. the entire physical memory
 * of the physheap is contiguously mapped into the device's virtual address
 * space in one go during device init. The premapping is done using a separate
 * set of physheaps suffixed with _PREMAP that cover the same range as the
 * base heaps (duplicates). Separate heaps are required for the premapping
 * allocations and the regular Fw objects allocated out of the regular heaps.
 *
 * NOTE: Enum order important, table in physheap.c must change if order changed.
